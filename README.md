# Virtual board tool ( A.I Based )

The main aim of this project is to provide one such approach is to
develop a tool that can somehow contribute in making our traditional
mentor-mentee (i.e. teacher-student, etc.) communication a bit easy.
Keeping in mind the requirements of the most common user the
whole platform is designed on the python programming language
using an IDE (like Visual Studio Code, etc.).

The Virtual-Board is an A.I. based tool which uses hand gestures being monitored by an
inbuilt system webcam or an external one, thus enabling the user to directly write upon the
screen of system virtually without making use of any additional gadgets like light pen or any
pen-tab type of format.
It involves three different types of ink pen support namely red (by default), blue and black
along with an eraser, in case if you want to erase some written text or any drawing on screen.
